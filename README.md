# Simplified Generation of Boolean Expressions

## Introduction
When I was introduced to a subject in my first semester that demonstrated the logical behavior of computers and circuits, I became very focused on it.

## Automated Truth Table
I didn't like the manual task of creating truth tables, extracting expressions, and testing them. All of this process was too much work, which didn't help with ADHD. So, I challenged myself to create a code that generates the truth table for any number of variables. This was the beginning of the "truth-table.py" project.

## Quine McCluskey Method
After learning about expression simplifications, I didn't like the Karnaugh method. Besides being manual and relatively complicated, it wasn't suitable for a variable number of variables. I talked to the professor to show me a computable method, and he introduced me to the Quine McCluskey Method. So, I proposed myself the challenge: if I could apply the method programmatically, I wouldn't need to take the final exam. And there it is, the "Simplifier_Quine_Method.py" code.

## Conclusion
I really enjoyed developing these two implementations, and although they weren't done with best practices (it was just my first semester), they were well above my level. I plan to refactor them in the future.
